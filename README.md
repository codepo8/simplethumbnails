# Simple Thumbnails

Creates a set of thumbnails from a set of dropped images, downloadable as a zip.

## Demo

You can see the live version here: http://makethumbnails.com/#dropzone

And there is a video demo on the YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrN1ujTHTHI

## Requirements and support

Uses Stuart Knightley's JSZip: http://stuk.github.io/jszip/
and Eli Grey's FileSaver: https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/

It was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari on OSX. I also showed it to a cat and it approved.

## Things that aren't issues

Yes, this doesn't work on a mobile. I dare you to drag and drop images into a browser on a mobile though and download thumbnails as a zip - it's a use case thing.
This is live and such - all gulping and grunting was done by me, not by any script.
